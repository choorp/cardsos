#CardsOS

Current status: Pre-alpha

Live demo: [CardsOS](https://cardsos.choorp.com)

###What is this?
CardsOS is a simple web app that tries to simulate the webOS experience. This is very much a work in progress and still in the hacking around and experimenting phase. Still, it's kinda fun to play around with in its current form. As you'll find out, there's still a lot left to do.

###What works?
- Launching apps from the quick launcher. Currently, only Dash Weather and FoxCasts are available.
- Device Menu. Shows real battery status and has a button to show that app in full screen mode.
- Launcher, but apps are not able to be launched from here yet.
- Drag cards to the top or bottom of the screen to close them.

###Issues?
You bet. Remember, this is no where near finished yet. In its current state, CardsOS works best on Android and Chrome as that's what I'm using to develop it. Firefox seems to perform pretty well too. A touch-enabled device is best.

###Why did you make this?
Fun, to learn new things, and to create an interesting way to show off my other apps.

As this is only my second Angular2/TypeScript project, expect the code to be a little messy. :)
