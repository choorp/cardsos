# CardsOS

CardsOS is a web app that simulates some basic webOS functionality. Things like cards, the launcher, device menu, etc. It's still in the very early stages, but good progress is being made.

## Why?

A couple reasons! Most of all, I thought it would be fun. I've always loved webOS and really enjoy being able to get a similar experience on the phone or tablet I carry around regularly. I also needed a decently-sized project to better learn Angular2 and TypeScript.
